# Comparative Analysis of Linearity in Fluorophores Under Varying Laser Excitation Power

### **Key Points**

* A linear region exists between 6 and 8mW for both fluorophores.
* The 605nm fluorophore's linear range extends slightly farther to 10mW.
* Beyond 10mW, the behavior of the two fluorophores diverges significantly ([Fig 1](comparative-analysis-of-linearity-in-fluorophores-under-varying-laser-excitation-power.md#figures)).
* For optimal results, the excitation laser should not exceed 8mW ([Fig 1](comparative-analysis-of-linearity-in-fluorophores-under-varying-laser-excitation-power.md#figures)).
* Between 6 and 8mW excitation power, the responses of the two fluorophores differ mainly by a vertical shift and increased slope ([Fig 1](comparative-analysis-of-linearity-in-fluorophores-under-varying-laser-excitation-power.md#figures)).
* Additional tuning is required

### **Experimental Procedure**

1. A fresh dilute sample of 605nm fluorophore was placed onto a glass slide.
2. A single fluorophore was brought into focus.
3. The fluorophore was measured using the full wave at half power method at a magnification of 39x.
4. The size of the bead was determined to be approximately 3.5 microns.
5. The bead was placed at a known location near the center of the EBIS frame.
6. The camera settings to best visualize the DFA structures.
7. The excitation source was modulated between 0 and P, increasing the value of P from 2 to 20mW.
8. At each increment several modulations were recorded.
9. Steps 1-8 were repeated for the 625nm fluorophore.
10. The size of the 625 nm fluorophore was determined to be 2.5 microns.
11. The average number of events at the negative impulses created by the excitation source turning off was calculated for both flurophores ([Fig 1](comparative-analysis-of-linearity-in-fluorophores-under-varying-laser-excitation-power.md#figures)).

### **Results**&#x20;

For both the 605nm and 625nm fluorophores, the results demonstrate a linear region between 6 and 8mW. Notably, the 605nm fluorophore's linear range extends a bit further, reaching up to 10mW. Beyond this power level, the behavior of the two fluorophores becomes distinctly different. The 605nm fluorophore largely maintains its linearity, while the 625nm fluorophore deviates from linear behavior. It is worth noting that the relationship between the two responses within their corresponding linear range appears to be a linear one, defined primarily by a vertical shift and increased slope. The results for the 605nm still indicate some level of saturation ([Fig 2](comparative-analysis-of-linearity-in-fluorophores-under-varying-laser-excitation-power.md#figures)), so there remains room to adjust the bias settings before adjusting the power.

### **Discussion**&#x20;

The outcomes of the experiment provide vital insights into the behavior of the two fluorophores under varying laser excitation powers. One of the primary takeaways is the identification of the optimal power range. It is evident that to achieve the best results, the excitation laser should be maintained at or below 8mW. This ensures the maintenance of linearity and minimizes potential errors or deviations in measurements.

Furthermore, the relationship between the responses of the 605nm and 625nm fluorophores in the 6 to 8mW range is particularly intriguing. Their differences seem to be characterized predominantly by a vertical shift and steeper slope. This suggests that when working with both fluorophores, the power level can be adjusted independently without compromising linearity. This adaptability is a significant advantage, especially given the rapid saturation observed in the 625nm fluorophore ([Fig 3](comparative-analysis-of-linearity-in-fluorophores-under-varying-laser-excitation-power.md#figures)).

In terms of future steps, it may be beneficial to further investigate the reasons behind the distinct divergence in behavior beyond 10mW. Understanding the underlying mechanisms could lead to better calibration techniques and more accurate results. To that end, the spectra of the dichroic mirror and excitation filter were plotted together to provide insight to the excitation response of the two wavelengths ([Fig 4](comparative-analysis-of-linearity-in-fluorophores-under-varying-laser-excitation-power.md#figures)). The results also suggest that to achieve a reliable result for both fluorophores, independent power modulation may be required.
