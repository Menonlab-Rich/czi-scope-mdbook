# Detailed Report on CMOS and Event Stream Alignment Challenges

### Executive Summary

Aligning CMOS camera frames with an event sensor data stream presents unique challenges due to the absence of native timestamping in the CMOS camera output and discrepancies arising from the camera and event sensor interaction. Typically, in datasets exceeding 1000 frames, we observe 3 to 5 discrepancies attributed to:

1. Unsaved CMOS frames despite trigger events being sent.
2. Unregistered trigger events.
3. Multiple trigger events for a single CMOS frame.

Determining the root cause of these discrepancies is crucial for accurate data analysis. This report outlines the challenges faced and the steps taken to address them, culminating in an updated algorithm for saving CMOS frames with high-precision timestamps to improve alignment accuracy.

### Challenges Identified

#### Lack of Native Timestamps

The core issue stems from the CMOS camera's lack of native timestamping capability, forcing reliance on the assumption that the number of frames and trigger events should match. This assumption breaks down when discrepancies occur, complicating the alignment process.

#### Types of Discrepancies

Discrepancies can be categorized into three main types:

1. **CMOS Frame Loss**: A frame is not saved, but a trigger event is sent.
2. **Trigger Event Loss**: A trigger event fails to register.
3. **Multiple Triggers**: Several trigger events are registered for a single CMOS frame.

#### Propagation of Errors

A single discrepancy, if not correctly identified and addressed, can cascade, causing subsequent frames to misalign. This error propagation significantly impacts the reliability of data analysis.

#### Alignment Challenges

The sequential alignment based on frame and trigger counts is unreliable due to potential misalignments between trigger timestamps and CMOS frames. Without direct temporal correlation, determining the correct sequence and addressing discrepancies becomes challenging.

### Resolution Strategy

#### Introduction of High-Precision Timestamps

To mitigate these challenges, we have updated the CMOS frame saving algorithm to include a high-precision timestamp (accurate to the microsecond) when each frame is stored in memory. These absolute timestamps, while not directly corresponding to event stream timestamps, provide a crucial reference point for alignment.

#### Analyzing Temporal Deltas

By examining the deltas between consecutive CMOS images and comparing these against the deltas between sequentially corresponding trigger events, we can infer the nature of discrepancies. This comparison allows us to identify instances of frame loss, unregistered triggers, or multiple triggers more accurately.

#### Algorithmic Improvements

The updated approach involves:

1. **Timestamp Recording**: Each CMOS frame is timestamped upon storage, providing a reliable temporal reference.
2. **Delta Comparison**: The algorithm compares temporal deltas between CMOS frames and trigger events to identify discrepancies.
3. **Discrepancy Resolution**: Based on delta analysis, the algorithm determines the most likely cause of each discrepancy and takes appropriate corrective action, such as skipping frames or triggers, to realign the data streams.

### Conclusion and Future Work

The introduction of high-precision timestamps for CMOS frames represents a significant step forward in resolving alignment challenges between CMOS frames and event sensor data streams. By leveraging temporal deltas, we can more accurately diagnose and correct discrepancies, enhancing the reliability of subsequent data analysis.

Future work will focus on refining the discrepancy resolution process and further optimizing the alignment algorithm for efficiency and accuracy. Continuous improvement in these areas will contribute to more robust data synchronization methodologies, crucial for advanced applications requiring precise temporal alignment of multimodal data streams.
