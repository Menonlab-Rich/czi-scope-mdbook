# Imaging of 625nm Fluorophore with and without DFA Modulation

### **Key Points**

* Two sets of data were exported: the 625nm fluorophore unmodulated without the DFA and the 625nm fluorophore modulated with the DFA.
* Ideal data collection would encompass both the 625nm and 605nm fluorophores in various configurations.
* Current data for the 605nm fluorophore is not well-suited for the light intensity provided, resulting in diminished results at sub-millisecond frame rates.
* The 625nm unmodulated signal was captured at 500fps with an integration time of 2ms.
* The 625nm modulated signal was captured at 2000fps with an integration time of 500us. This could potentially increase to 3.33 thousand FPS with proper tuning.

### **Experimental Process:**

1. Exported videos of the 625nm fluorophore in two configurations: unmodulated without the DFA and modulated with the DFA.
2. Adjusted camera settings for the 625nm unmodulated signal to achieve an imaging frame rate of 500fps and an integration time of 2ms.
3. Modified camera settings for the 625nm modulated signal to achieve an imaging frame rate of 2000fps and an integration time of 500us.

### **Results**&#x20;

The 625nm unmodulated signal without the DFA was successfully imaged at a maximum frame rate of 500fps and an integration time of 2ms. On the other hand, the 625nm modulated signal with the DFA was imaged at 2000fps with an integration time of 500us. Preliminary analyses suggest that with proper tuning, the frame rate for the modulated signal could potentially be increased to approximately 3.33 thousand FPS.

### **Discussion**&#x20;

The data obtained from the 625nm fluorophore, both modulated and unmodulated, provides valuable insights into the imaging capabilities of our system. It is evident that the 605nm fluorophore requires more specific tuning to achieve optimum imaging results. The absence of comprehensive data for both fluorophores in different configurations underscores the need for a more thorough data collection strategy. Future efforts should prioritize obtaining the missing data sets, especially for the 605nm fluorophore, to facilitate a more comprehensive analysis. Additionally, the potential to increase the frame rate for the modulated 625nm signal to 3.33 thousand FPS offers promising avenues for future optimizations and applications.
